0x08-making-change: Coin Change Problem in Python
This project tackles the classic coin change problem, a dynamic programming challenge. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a given total amount using a list of available coin denominations.

Project Objectives:

Implement an algorithm to solve the coin change problem.
Choose between a greedy algorithm or dynamic programming based on efficiency and correctness.
Apply concepts like dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and algorithmic complexity.
Utilize Python programming skills for list manipulation, loops, and conditionals.
Concepts Covered:

Greedy Algorithms: Their suitability for coin change problems and limitations.
Dynamic Programming: Principles, overlapping subproblems, and optimal substructure.
Algorithmic Complexity: Analyzing time and space complexity of algorithms.
Problem-Solving Strategies: Breaking problems into subproblems and choosing iterative vs recursive approaches.
Python Programming: List manipulation, list comprehensions, loops, and conditionals.
